/*
  Main scss file, please add only imports here.
  All scss declarations should be declared in their specific folder and imported
  in _index.scss belonging to that folder.

  Index imports are in this specific order for a reason, please don't change that.

  Variables should be imported first, so that project's variables would override bootstrap's variables.
  Vendors come with 3rd party variables, which you may want to manipulate in sass functions inside helpers/.
  Base contains global styles, such as, typography, grid, font-face definitions etc.
  Inside helpers/, one can generate global utility classes which can be then extended in other classes below.
  Utils can extend all the classes above.
  Layout / components usually use utilities and variables, and are the bottom leafs of the scss dependency tree.
  Layout is first, because is more general than components.

  Finally, _shame.scss, which should be used as occasionally as possible.
