/*
  This file, dramatically titled _shame.scss, consists of all the CSS declarations, hacks and things we are not proud of.
  It would be imported after any other file, at the very end of the stylesheet.

  Leave here any classes that are a temporary fix or those for is enough time to refactor,
  with a comment to let others know why you did that.
